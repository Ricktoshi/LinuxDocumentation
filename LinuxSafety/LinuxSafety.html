<h2> 1 HDD encryption </h2>
<p>
 At installation time, most distros will have the option to encrypt your HDD. Do it! You know
you can get access to the data on a PC by simple using a bootable pen drive. This way your information will be more secure.
</p>

<h3>2 Install UFW</h3>


<h3> 3 Install anti virus Clam Tk </h3>
<p>
Linux does not suffer the same ilments as Windos, still "there are" some viruses out there for Linux. All distros I have used include Clam in their software repos.
</p>


Super user.
<p>
I recommend setting a separate password for root from your account password. Also, if several people use the same machine, do take the time to see if any of them require access to sudo.
</p>


Disable SSH root login.
<P>
Edit the sshd_config file. It is the main configuration file for the sshd service.
Open The file at: /etc/ssh/. You need to be logged in as root.
Look for the line #PermitRootLogin no. and un comment it. If not present, add it.
Restart the sshd service:
		In Debian based distros $ /etc/init.d/sshd restart

		In Manjaro Arch/Manjaro $ systemctl restart sshd


Now if someone wants to hack you via SSH, they would need to know your user ID, password and root password.
